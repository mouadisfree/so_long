# so_long - My 2D Game


*My first 2D game project*
---
## What is this?
**so_long** is a 2D game where you collect items and find the exit that I wrote myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how to make graphics, handle events, and create interactive programs. I'll use these game development skills in other projects later.

## What I Built

### Game Elements
- **Player**: Character you control with WASD keys
- **Collectibles**: Items to gather before exiting
- **Exit**: Door to finish the level

### Game Features
- **Map Parsing**: Read and validate `.ber` map files
- **Graphics**: Display sprites using MiniLibX
- **Controls**: Keyboard input handling

### Bonus Features
- `Enemies`: Moving obstacles that add challenge
- `Animations`: Animated sprites for better visuals
- `Move Counter`: Track how many steps you take

## How to use it

### What you need
To play this game, you need:
- A C compiler (like `gcc`) to turn code into programs.
- A computer with Linux or macOS.

### How to set it up
1. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mkatfi/so_long.git
   cd so_long


2. Build the game:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This makes a program called `so_long` that runs the game.
